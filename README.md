# portfolioWebsite
A VSCode themed personal portfolio website.
After working with many different editors, VSCode very quickly became my favorite and I decided that my website should look the same.

It was built from the most basic building blocks: JavaScript, HTML5 and CSS3. 
I wanted to make sure that every line was written by me with no use of libraries or frameworks.

The only external tool I used is the PHPMailer that allows me to receive emails without the need in a database.

Enjoy!
